# Generative Deep Learning

This repository is intended as place to keep my current experimentations on generative deep learning using tensorflow.

Most of the code is based on the Coursera course [Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-deep-learning-with-tensorflow/home/welcome) by Laurence Moroney and Eddy Shyu.



## Fast Neural Style Transfer

Paper describing Fast Neural Style Transfer can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06830).

The model is provided by [Tensorflow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2).

Figure below illustrate the main concept of Neural Style Transfer, which is based on the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) (Gatys, Ecker & Bethge, 2015).
